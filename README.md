Ultima Onlineâ„¢ Map Creator
==========================
This project is an open source version of UOLandscaper developed in C#...
The original was software suite was developed in VB by Dknight of OrBSydia GameNET 
--------------------------
Software Description:
This project has been something I've wanted to take on for years. The original software suite was not open source and it had so many issues with it, but the developer refused to update it and create a more stable version. Well I have spoken to that developer and, although he's refused to let me re-release the original VB source code, he never said I couldn't re-write and re-distribute the C# conversion. In fact he said that anyone is free to look at the code and create their own versions, which I found funny because he "borrowed" the core/engine of his software from Ryandor's Dragon map making software suite.
--------------------------
Licensing/Legalities:
None. Technically this software is provided as-is and should fall under the GNU-GPL Version 2 License because it is software that, directly or indirectly, is meant to be used with the RunUO/ServUO/PlayUO emulations which all fall under that license.
That means, by my open sourcing the software, you all are free to download and make changes to the code as you see fit. The catch is that none of you may sell or make a profit from this software. However it may be distributed freely.

Install Directions:
Just use GIT or download the .zip package and extract everything into a folder of your choice. I've included a .pdf file which explains how each program works. I will also be including online video tutorials as well.*

*The .pdf file is not available at this time. I'm still polishing up the software so please be patient. Thank you.
